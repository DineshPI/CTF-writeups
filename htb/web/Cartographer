Viewing the source code didnt give much of a clue.
searched for XSS vulnerabilities and never found one
since it asked for Username and password,decided to do SQL injection
Unfamiliar with the attack installed SQLMAP to do it.
Later realized there was no GET request in the webpage for sqlmap to work with.(Stupid me!!!)

Tried simple sql injections one by one and found a working one.
UserName:  ' or ''=' 
Password:  ' or ''='

Hit a wall again but this time the URL had a parameter ...

replaced it with a XSS script(that's only thing i know) didnt't work .
since we are searching for a flag (Obviously...)

http://docker.hackthebox.eu:59517/panel.php?info=flag
gave the flag ...HTB{*sorry cannot spoil*}
